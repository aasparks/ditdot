# Scripndots

This repo contains my dot files and scripts I write to make my life easy.

## Usage

The scripts directory contains scripts that automate bringing a fresh install up 
to working condition. They install programs I use regularly and replace some system
settings that I use as well.

The dots directory contains the dotfiles and installers for all the programs I use
that have dotfiles. 

### Dotfile Programs

* awesome Window Manager
* zsh
* spacemacs

## Other Installs

* Inconsolata Font
* Dvorak keyboard layout with switching to regular US with LCTRL + RCTRL. Also swaps the caps lock and esc keys for vim 
use.
* Fix-alsa.sh. I needed to do this on one of my machines.
It's there for reference.
* Racket lang and DrRacket
* Sonic-lambda, my sonic-pi remake
* NodeJS
* Keypass

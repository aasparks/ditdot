# ditdot

This repo contains my dot files and scripts I write to make my life easy.

## Usage

The easiest way to use this repo is to run 

```./install``` 

from the root directory. This will prompt you to install
individual programs. To install and configure everything,
run the script with 

```./install -y```. 

To install and confiure modules individually, cd into
```scripts/config``` or ```scripts/install``` and run
the script named after the program you want to install
or configure.
